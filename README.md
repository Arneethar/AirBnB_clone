# AirBnB_clone - console
The major aim of this project is to design a clone cope of the AirBnB Website.
It might not implement all the features, but it will cover all the fundamental concept of the AirBnB website.

#The first step is to write a command interpreter to manage the AirBnb objects

What’s a command interpreter?
Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object
